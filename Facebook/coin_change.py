This solution is inspired by the BFS solution for problem Perfect Square. Since it is to find the least
coin solution (like a shortest path from 0 to amount), using BFS gives results much faster than DP.

                        visited[newval] = True

#DP Code
Assume dp[i] is the fewest number of coins making up amount i, then for every coin in coins, dp[i] = min(dp[i - coin] + 1).

The time complexity is O(amount * coins.length) and the space complexity is O(amount)

class Solution(object):
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        MAX = float('inf')
        dp = [0] + [MAX] * amount

        for i in xrange(1, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min([dp[i - c] if i - c >= 0 else MAX for c in coins]) + 1

        return [dp[amount], -1][dp[amount] == MAX]
